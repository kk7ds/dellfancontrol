# Sensors to monitor. Probe each of these sensors and calculate the delta
# between "current" and "target". We feed the maximum delta to the PID loop
# and thus the sensor with the largest positive value over the target will
# drive our cooling behavior. Any sensor with no target value will not drive
# the PID loop, but will be considered for panic behavior, where we switch
# back to system-managed fans.

    # no target is set, we will only consider it for panic (if set) and log
    # its value.

    # Setting a panic limit means that if this sensor ever exceeds this
    # threshold, we will revert to system-managed fan controls. If no panic
    # level is set, we will never let it push us into system-managed mode.

  # IPMI "Temp" is the maximum CPU temp, which fluctuates a lot. If it goes
  # over a certain level it will start being managed, but we really want
